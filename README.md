# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA PROJECT

This repository contains the description of the program used to complete the programming assigment for the GETTING AND CLEANING DATA course.
The assumption is that the file with the measures has been downloaded and uncompressed. 
This script has to be executed in the root directory of the uncompressed file.
